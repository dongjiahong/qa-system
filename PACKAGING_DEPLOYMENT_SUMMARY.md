# Knowledge QA System - Packaging and Deployment Summary

This document summarizes the packaging and deployment capabilities implemented for the Knowledge QA System.

## üì¶ Packaging Features

### 1. Project Configuration
- **pyproject.toml**: Complete project metadata and build configuration
- **MANIFEST.in**: Controls which files are included in distributions
- **requirements.txt**: Production dependencies
- **requirements-dev.txt**: Development dependencies

### 2. Build Script (`build_package.py`)
- Automated build process with quality checks
- Test execution before building
- Code linting and formatting verification
- Package building (wheel and source distribution)
- PyPI upload capability (test and production)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Usage:**
```bash
# Build package with all checks
python build_package.py

# Skip tests and linting
python build_package.py --skip-tests --skip-lint

# Upload to TestPyPI
python build_package.py --upload test

# Clean build artifacts only
python build_package.py --clean-only
```

## üê≥ Docker Configuration

### 1. Dockerfile
- Multi-stage build optimization
- Python 3.12 slim base image
- Non-root user for security
- Health checks included
- Proper layer caching

### 2. docker-compose.yml
- Complete service orchestration
- Includes Ollama (LLM service)
- Includes ChromaDB (vector database)
- Volume persistence for data and logs
- Network isolation
- Automatic service dependencies

### 3. .dockerignore
- Optimized build context
- Excludes development files
- Reduces image size

## üöÄ Deployment Tools

### 1. Deployment Script (`deploy.sh`)
Comprehensive deployment automation with multiple commands:

- **deploy**: Full Docker Compose deployment
- **build**: Build Docker image only
- **start/stop/restart**: Service management
- **status**: Health checks and logs
- **cleanup**: Complete cleanup
- **local**: Local installation without Docker
- **check**: Environment verification

**Features:**
- Colored output for better UX
- Dependency checking
- Service health verification
- Error handling and logging
- Environment setup automation

### 2. Environment Checker (`check_environment.py`)
Comprehensive environment validation:

- Python version verification
- Package availability checks
- Docker and Docker Compose status
- Service health checks (Ollama, ChromaDB)
- Project structure validation
- Environment variable verification
- Disk space monitoring
- Detailed reporting with color-coded output

## üìã Makefile Integration

Updated Makefile with new commands:
- `make package`: Build package distribution
- `make deploy`: Deploy using Docker Compose
- `make docker-build`: Build Docker image
- `make docker-deploy`: Deploy with Docker
- `make check-env`: Run environment checks

## üìö Documentation

### 1. DEPLOYMENT.md
Comprehensive deployment guide covering:
- Quick start instructions
- Multiple deployment options
- Configuration details
- Troubleshooting guide
- Performance tuning
- Security considerations
- Monitoring and backup strategies

### 2. PACKAGING_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md
This summary document providing overview of all features.

## üîß Configuration Files

### Environment Configuration
- `.env.example`: Template for environment variables
- Environment variable support for all services
- Docker-specific and local deployment configurations

### Service Configuration
- Ollama model management (Qwen)
- ChromaDB vector storage setup
- Persistent data and log directories
- Network configuration for service communication

## ‚úÖ Quality Assurance

### Testing Integration
- Automated test execution before packaging
- Code quality checks (Black, isort, flake8, mypy)
- Coverage reporting
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

### Health Monitoring
- Service health checks in Docker
- Environment validation tools
- Comprehensive logging
- Error reporting and diagnostics

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Quick Deployment
```bash
# Check environment
python check_environment.py

# Deploy everything
./deploy.sh deploy

# Check status
./deploy.sh status
```

### Package Building
```bash
# Build and test package
python build_package.py

# Upload to test repository
python build_package.py --upload test
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Install locally
./deploy.sh local

# Activate and use
source venv/bin/activate
knowledge --help
```

## üîí Security Features
